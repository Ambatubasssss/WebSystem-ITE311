# Role Management System

## Overview
The role management system is integrated directly into the admin navigation dropdown, allowing administrators to edit user roles while protecting the admin role from modification. This system uses AJAX calls for seamless role management without page reloads.

## Features

- **Real-time Role Editing**: Change teacher and student roles with dropdown selects
- **Admin Protection**: Admin roles cannot be edited for security

- **Secure Access**: Only admin users can access role management
- **Visual Feedback**: Success/error notifications for role changes

### ðŸ”’ Security Features
- Admin role is protected and cannot be edited
- Only admin users can access role management functionality
- CSRF protection on all AJAX requests
- Input validation for role changes
- Session-based authentication checks

## How to Use

### Accessing Role Management
1. Login as an admin user (admin@example.com / Admin@123)
2. Click "Manage Users" dropdown in the navigation menu
3. The system will load all users with their current roles

### Editing User Roles
1. In the dropdown table, find the user you want to modify
2. Use the dropdown select in the "Actions" column
3. Choose between "Teacher" or "Student" role
4. Confirm the change when prompted
5. The role will be updated immediately with visual feedback

### Role Types
- **Admin**: Full system access, cannot be edited
- **Teacher**: Can manage courses and students
- **Student**: Can enroll in courses and submit assignments

## Technical Implementation

### Routes
- `GET /admin/users` - Get all users (AJAX endpoint)
- `POST /admin/roles/update/{id}` - Update user role (AJAX endpoint)

### Controller Methods
- `Admin::getUsers()` - Return JSON list of all users
- `Admin::updateRole($userId)` - Process role update and return JSON response

### Integration
- Role management is integrated directly into `app/Views/templates/header.php`
- Uses JavaScript/AJAX for seamless user experience
- No separate views needed - everything works within the existing template structure

## Database Schema
The system uses the existing `users` table with the following relevant fields:
- `id` - Primary key
- `name` - User's full name
- `email` - User's email address
- `role` - User's role (admin, teacher, student)
- `created_at` - Account creation timestamp
- `updated_at` - Last update timestamp

## Security Considerations
1. **Admin Role Protection**: Admin roles cannot be changed through the interface
2. **Access Control**: Only admin users can access role management
3. **Input Validation**: Role values are validated against allowed options
4. **CSRF Protection**: All forms include CSRF tokens
5. **Session Validation**: All actions check for valid admin session

## Testing
To test the role management system:
1. Login as admin (admin@example.com / Admin@123)
2. Navigate to "Manage Roles" in the navigation
3. Try editing a teacher or student role
4. Verify admin roles show as "Protected"
5. Test with non-admin users to ensure access is denied
